This code is built to keep the robot in a straight line as much as possible during a drag race, minimizing time loss caused by uneven movement. Precision is key to winning! 🎯

## 📦 Tools & Compatibility

✅ Programming Language: Python 🐍
✅ Developed With: VEXcode IQ 🦾
✅ Also Works On: Visual Studio Code 💻

## 🔧 How It Works
•	The program continuously adjusts the robot’s movement to maintain a straight path.
•	Helps reduce drift and optimize speed for better performance.
•	Simple, effective, and fun to experiment with! 🚀
